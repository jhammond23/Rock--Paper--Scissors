Built in Python and played in Trinket, using object oriented programming, this Rock, paper, scissors game was a fun way to showcase coding skills by adding different types of opponents. This simulator allows the user to switch between a player, random, and cascading style opponent. Showing the overall match score at the end of each round, the game is won by a player winning 3 seperate rounds.

A demo of this game is available online via the website in my bio, or you can download it here to play.
